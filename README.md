## Executive Summary

This project implements an Agentic Reasoning System that addresses the challenge of structured multi-step reasoning in complex logic problems. The system autonomously decomposes questions into manageable subproblems, selects appropriate solving tools, executes solutions with verification, and generates transparent reasoning traces.

- Autonomous Problem Decomposition: Breaking complex questions into solvable subproblems
- Intelligent Tool Selection: Choosing symbolic solvers, calculators, or specialized algorithms
- Rigorous Verification: Cross-checking results and ensuring correctness
- Transparent Reasoning Traces: Providing step-by-step audit trails for interpretability
- Strong Dataset Performance: Achieving 61.04% validation accuracy with novel approaches

### Key Objectives Met

## Problem Decomposition & Reasoning Approach

### Multi-Step Reasoning Strategy

The system employs a hierarchical decomposition approach for complex problem-solving.

#### Step 1: Problem Type Identification

```
Question Analysis -> Keyword Extraction -> Pattern Matching -> Route to Solver
```

The router analyzes the question text for domain-specific keywords and patterns to classify the problem type.

#### Step 2: Solver-Specific Decomposition

Each solver implements its own decomposition strategy optimized for its domain.

**Example 1: Gear Chain Problem**

```
1. Parse gear configuration (A -> B -> C with chain/belt connections)
2. Extract parameters:
   - Teeth count for each gear
   - Initial RPM
   - Connection types (direct mesh vs chain/belt)
3. Apply physics formulas:
   - Direct mesh: final_rpm = initial_rpm  (teeth_driven / teeth_driver)
   - Chain drive: final_rpm = initial_rpm  (teeth_B / teeth_A)
4. Calculate final answer
5. Match result to closest option
```

**Example 2: Number Sequence Pattern**

```
1. Extract number sequence from question text
2. Test multiple pattern hypotheses:
   - Arithmetic progression (constant difference)
   - Geometric progression (constant ratio)
   - Fibonacci-like (sum of previous terms)
   - Look-and-say (visual counting)
   - Digit sum patterns
3. Validate pattern with given terms
4. Predict next term using validated pattern
5. Match to available options
```

**Example 3: Logic Puzzle (Allocation)**

```
1. Parse entities and constraints from text
2. Extract person-item pairings from each option
3. Check constraint violations:
   - "Eva doesn't like cherries" -> reject options with "Eva: cherry"
   - "Zara prefers blueberry" -> prefer options with "Zara: blueberry"
4. Score each option based on constraint satisfaction
5. Select highest scoring option
```

#### Step 3: Verification Loop

```
Initial Answer -> Cross-Validation -> Confidence Check -> Final Decision
     |                                      |
  (Low Confidence)                    (High Confidence)
     |                                      |
  Retry with Alternative Solver         Return Answer
```

### Handling Edge Cases

1. Ambiguous Questions: Use Option 5 ("Cannot be determined") when confidence < 0.4
2. Contradictory Constraints: Apply meta-reasoning to detect logical impossibilities
3. Missing Information: Explicit fallback to "Cannot be determined"
4. Trick Questions: LogicalTrapSolver detects self-reference and paradoxes
5. Multiple Valid Interpretations: Use ensemble voting across solvers
